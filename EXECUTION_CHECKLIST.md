## 🧪 API Testing (Optional - for Viva)

Use Postman or Thunder Client to test:

### Test 1: Health Check
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### Test 2: Search API
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/movies/search?query=dark&minRating=8
```

### Test 3: Trending API
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/movies/trending
```

### Test 4: User History API
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/users/{USER_ID}/history
```
(Get USER_ID from the user dropdown or database)

### Test 5: Review Stats API
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/movies/{MOVIE_ID}/reviews/stats
```

## 🎓 Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: Why use text indexes?**
A: For efficient full-text search across multiple fields (title, director, cast) without multiple regex queries.

**Q: Explain the hybrid ranking formula.**
A: Combines text relevance (50%), movie rating (30%), and popularity (20%) for balanced search results.

**Q: Why compound indexes?**
A: For efficient queries that filter/sort on multiple fields, like {userId, timestamp} for history queries.

**Q: How does fuzzy matching work?**
A: Uses string-similarity library to calculate similarity scores between search query and movie fields.

**Q: Why pagination?**
A: To avoid loading all documents at once, improving performance and user experience.

**Q: Why use aggregation pipeline?**
A: For complex data transformations like grouping, joining, and calculating statistics in the database.

## ✨ Demo Script (5 Minutes)

### Minute 1: Introduction
"This is a movie streaming platform backend with MongoDB. It features advanced search, user tracking, and reviews."

### Minute 2: Search Demo
"Let me search for 'action' movies with minimum rating 7. Notice the hybrid ranking scores that combine text relevance, rating, and popularity."

### Minute 3: Trending
"Here are the top 5 most-watched movies in the last 30 days, calculated using MongoDB aggregation pipeline."

### Minute 4: User History
"Selecting a user shows their complete watch history with statistics like total watch time and favorite genre."

### Minute 5: Reviews

## 🔧 Troubleshooting During Demo

**If search returns no results:**
- Check if database is seeded
- Verify MongoDB connection
- Try a common term like "the"

**If MongoDB connection fails:**
```bash
brew services restart mongodb-community
```

**If port 5000 is busy:**
- Change PORT in .env to 3000
- Restart server

**If frontend doesn't load:**
- Check console for errors
- Verify API_BASE_URL in script.js
- Check CORS settings
